# Shopping Cart Project Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## Live Site: https://next-js-shopping-cart-eight.vercel.app/cart

### Project Objective

This project aimed to gain experience using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

I employed the new app router to create the following pages

- home
- Product
- Products details
- Cart Page

To manage data and facilitate data manipulation, I utilized context, passing data and functions, it's important to note that the components utilizing context should be client components.

### Challenges

While trying to deploy my website on Netlify, I faced a runtime error that read "Runtime.ImportModuleError - Error: Cannot find module 'styled-jsx/style' in the required stack." This error would occur whenever I clicked on any of the products. To Solve this issue, I opted to deploy the website on Vercel.
